- **Object Modeling Techniques (OMT):**
  - Method for visualizing and documenting software systems.
  - Techniques: Object Modeling, Dynamic Modeling, Functional Modeling.

- **Comparison (OOAD vs. OOP):**
  - OOAD: Conceptual modeling, use case diagrams.
  - OOP: Implementation, coding using classes and objects.

- **Goals of UML:**
  - Standardization, Visualization, Specification, Modeling Abstractions, Flexibility.

- **Advantages of Object-Oriented Development:**
  - Modularity, Reusability, Flexibility, Ease of Maintenance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Improved Code Organization, Code Maintainability, Support for Real-world Modeling, Support for Inheritance and Polymorphism, Collaborative Development.

- **Explanation and Code Examples:**
  - Constructor, Object, Interface, Polymorphism, Class.

- **Types of Associations (Relationships):**
  - Aggregation, Composition, Association.

- **Class Diagram:**
  - Definition: Static structure diagram.
  - Usage: Visualizes, documents, and designs object-oriented systems.
  - Steps: Identify classes, relationships, add attributes and methods, draw connections, add multiplicities, review and refine.

This concise summary captures the main points from Part A of the Object-Oriented Programming II Assignment in Java.

## [PART B] (https://github.com/breenobare/AssighnmentJava/blob/main/PARTB.md)


**Fibonacci Sequence:**
- Generates Fibonacci sequence by adding previous two terms.
- Finds the sum of even-valued terms below four million.
- Java method `sumEvenFibonacci` calculates the sum.

**Palindrome Checker GUI:**
- Checks if a number entered by the user is a palindrome.
- Provides a GUI interface for user input and result display.
- `isPalindrome` method checks if a string is a palindrome.

**Array Operations (Question 4):**
- Reads 15 integers from the user and stores them in an array.
- Prints the array, checks if a user-entered number is present, and finds the index.
- Creates a new array with elements in reverse order and prints it.
- Calculates the sum and product of array elements.

These Java programs demonstrate tasks related to the Fibonacci sequence, palindrome checking with GUI, and various array operations.
