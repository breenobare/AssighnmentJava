- **Object Modeling Techniques (OMT):**
  - Method for visualizing and documenting software systems.
  - Techniques: Object Modeling, Dynamic Modeling, Functional Modeling.

- **Comparison (OOAD vs. OOP):**
  - OOAD: Conceptual modeling, use case diagrams.
  - OOP: Implementation, coding using classes and objects.

- **Goals of UML:**
  - Standardization, Visualization, Specification, Modeling Abstractions, Flexibility.

- **Advantages of Object-Oriented Development:**
  - Modularity, Reusability, Flexibility, Ease of Maintenance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Improved Code Organization, Code Maintainability, Support for Real-world Modeling, Support for Inheritance and Polymorphism, Collaborative Development.

- **Explanation and Code Examples:**
  - Constructor, Object, Interface, Polymorphism, Class.

- **Types of Associations (Relationships):**
  - Aggregation, Composition, Association.

- **Class Diagram:**
  - Definition: Static structure diagram.
  - Usage: Visualizes, documents, and designs object-oriented systems.
  - Steps: Identify classes, relationships, add attributes and methods, draw connections, add multiplicities, review and refine.
